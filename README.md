# Paul-Cram

Paul Cram [1952-2018] was a prolific Canadian jazz musician and composer. He was a founding member and artistic director of the Upstream Music Association and formed many jazz ensembles and orchestra groups throughout his career. He composed for such entities, as well as for radio (primarily CBC), film, and theatre.

The file included in this repository is a visual ontology of Cram's musical ecosystem. I attempted to illustrate the relationships Cram had to musicians and ensembels in an effort to track all the different groups and ensembles Cram had formed and been part of. By no means a complete account of all of Cram's relationships and ensembles he established, with probably more than a few errors, this is how I went about making sense of the impact Cram had on the musical community. Even incomplete, it is apparent that Cram (the yellow dot in the centre) had a profound influence as a connector in Canada's jazz scene. Creating this supplement to my learning helped me to visualize the impact of Cram's life and cognate influences on his life.
